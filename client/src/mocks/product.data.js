    description: `SUPPORT FOR CARDIO AND TRAINING.
    The Nike In-Season TR 9 is light, stable and features deep, comfortable footbed for superior impact absorption and energy return throughout your entire workout.
    Benefits
    Flat-to-the-ground “sit in” construction for medial and lateral arch support and containment.
    Foot-to-foam construction in the footbed and a dual-density cushioning gives it bounce and makes it totally runnable.
    An over-the-laces mid foot gore strap creates active containment and a more adaptive locked-in fit and feel.
    A durable, multidirectional traction pattern at high wear areas on the outsole.
    A memory foam sock liner provides the ultimate comfort.
    Jelly pull tab on the heel has a durable finish and creates a nice detail.
